Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The task I was assigned to complete was to write a program that displays interest rate growth over time.

What did you do particularly well?
I think my formatting was professional and easy to follow, alongside simple yet effective in-line comments explaining each function for different blocks of code.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think I could've included a way to check for negative values and throw the user and error message when the values returned would result in negative values.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found that printing the different values based on number of years passed was the most challenging part for me. If I'm being honest, most of my success came with trial and error. I spent most of my time tinkering and theory coding trying to find my solution. I've been using Codecademy to practice and hone my skills, which I will continue to do so for the future.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think practicing proper coding habits and neat formatting is an invaluable skill that I will definitely come in handy. Being able to easily read my code and find potential issues will be crucial to me in the future.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I focused on one step at a time, constantly debugging and testing as I wrote my code to detect any potential issues that may pop up. My inclusion of  in-line comments aalso helped me track blocks of code so if I had an issue with a certain aspect - for example, the menu interface - I could scroll and focus on that block much easier.
